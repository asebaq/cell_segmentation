# 3D segmentation of nuclei segmentation

## Segmentation Models 3D
- [ ] Combine folder `1` abd `2` of Fluo-N3DH-SIM+ data then
- [ ] Shuffling and splitting the data into train, val and test
- [ ] Adjust the inference script for multiple images instead for one image
- [ ] Use other datasets such as celegans and drosphilla datasets
- [ ] Add the archimedies optimizer to hypertuning the hyperparameters
- [ ] Try processing the ground truth into three classes(borders, cell, and background) multiclass segmentation. (Optional)
- [ ] Modify model architecture for more accuracy
- [ ] Add post processing to convert sementatic segmentation results into instance segmentation
- [ ] Compare with 3D object instance segmentation models such as cellpose, stardist, panopatic masckrcnn, detectron, and nnunet

## X-Unet
 - [ ] Train in Google Colab
 - [ ] Add block for instance segmentation in the archeticture
